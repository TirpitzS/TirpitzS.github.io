## Machine learning

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Concept Test

***1、Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam.What is the task T in this setting?***

A、Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

B、Watching you label emails as spam or not spam.

C、The number(or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam.

D、None of above--this is not a machine learing problem.

***2、You’re running a company, and you want to develop learning algorithms to address each of two problems.***

Problem 1: You have a large inventory of identical items.  You want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months.

Problem 2: You’d like software to examine individual customer accounts, and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised

Should you treat these as classification or as regression problems? 

A、Treat both as classification problems.

B、Treat problem 1 as a classification problem, problem 2 as a regression problem. 

C、Treat problem 1 as a regression problem, problem 2 as a classification problem. 

D、Treat both as regression problems. 

***3、Of the following examples, which would you address using an unsupervisedlearning algorithm?  (Check all that apply.)*** 

A、Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter.

B、Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into set of articles about the same story. 

C、Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments. 

D、 Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not. 

提示：回归问题的输出是一系列连续值，而分类的输出为散列值。

## Machine learning algorithms:

1、Supervised learning(监督学习)：In supervised learning, we are given a dataset and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
	
	a、Regression Problem:Predict real-valued output(根据之前的数据预测出一个准确值)
	b、Classification Problem:Predict discrete-valued output

2、Unsupervised learning(无监督学习)

3、Reinforcement learning(强化学习)

4、recommender systems(推荐系统)
